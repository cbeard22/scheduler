# Day Scheduler

# Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to create a scheduling site that would utilize local storage to save things to accomplish during the day. We were required to use luxon to get the current date and time that the page was loaded and print it to the header. The timed rows are then able to be typed in and saved and then when the page is reloaded it is still saved via your computers local storage.
